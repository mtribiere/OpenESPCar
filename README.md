# About the project
The aim of this project is to provide a fully-featured and generic plateform to create all kinds of ESP based RC car. 
From custom hardware to high-end API, everything is built from the ground-up.

# Tested hardware
For now on, ESP12f-based dev board, and L298N. However it should work with any other ESP board - H-bridge couple with minor changes.
