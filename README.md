# About the project
The aim of this project is to provide a fully-featured and generic plateform to create all kinds of ESP based RC car. 
From custom hardware to high-end API, everything is built from the ground-up.

# Current state
A first working POC has been made and tested successfully. However, there is still lots of things to do and maintenaing everything myself is not possible. 

# Hardware
For now on, <b>ESP12f-based</b> dev board, and <b>L298N</b>. However it should work with any other ESP board - H-bridge couple with minor changes.<br>
<br>
The overall architecture is pretty straight forward : 
 - The ESP board and motor drivers are placed inside the car
 - The ESP creates a Wifi AP and start-up a UDP server
 - The android smartphone connect to the Wifi AP
 - The App communicate starts a UDP client and communicate with the car
